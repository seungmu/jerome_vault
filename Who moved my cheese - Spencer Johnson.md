    - Haw finally realized they are doing same thing everyday and hoping things get better which is ridiculous. Hem still want to stay the same 
- 인용:
	- They wanted to sniff out the changes ahead of time and scurry into action, rather than get hemmed in and be left behind. 
		-   총체적인 책이 우리한테 말하고 싶은 것인것 같다. 미리미리 변화에 대해 감지 하고 그것에 대해 대응하고 행동을 하야지 우리는 변화에 뒤쳐 지지 않는다.
- 생각:
	- 네명의 캐릭터를 통해서 우리가 어떻게 살아가면서 변화에 대응해야 하며 또 어떻태도로 관계나 생활을 해나가야 하는지에 대해 알려주는것 같다.
- 평가
	- 얇지만 꽤나 큰 교훈을 주는 책이다. 볼때마다 무언가 새로운 것을 알게된다. 그래서 한동안에 한번씩 읽어도 괜찮을 듯한 책인다.
