- [[Zottelkasten Method]]
- Need two box, the first one is bibliographical one and another one is the main box.
    - I have reference folder and Idea folder
- Three steps:
    - 1. Take fleeting notes - it's a short and brief note that was taken whenever you have any idea
    - 2. Make literature notes - make a reference and use a short words to define it.
    - 3. Make permanent notes - use formal words to take note and this must be able to understand without any context and throw fleeting notes away.
    - 4. Add new note to the slip box:
        - 1. Put new notes at the end of the related notes
        - 2. Adding links to the related notes.
        - 3. Make sure you can find this note later either by link or in the folder.
